# Alternative SDL2 package for the Wii U

This repository has binary packages for
[this SDL2 fork](https://github.com/dkosmari/SDL/tree/wiiu-sdl2-devel).

It has experimental PRs not (yet) present on the official devkitPro repository.

## Versioning

Since pacman does not allow advanced versioning schemes, the packages here will use the
same version number as the official package. This way, pacman will never "upgrade" it back
to the official package, unless there's a new official release.
